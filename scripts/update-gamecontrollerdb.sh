#   scripts/update-gamecontrollerdb.sh OUTPUT [--own FILE] [--db FILE|URL]
#
# Takes the community SDL_GameControllerDB, keeps its "platform:Mac OS X" lines, appends
# the hand-written lines from FILE (default: the user's gamecontrollerdb.txt) last, keeps
# only the last line for each GUID and writes the result to OUTPUT. SDL lets a later line
# for a GUID replace an earlier one, so the own lines win. The run script points
# SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG_FILE at gamecontrollerdb.merged.txt next to gamecontrollerdb.txt.
#
# Windows and Linux lines are not converted: their button and axis indices come from
# DirectInput and evdev, which number a pad's controls differently from SDL's IOKit
# driver, so a converted GUID would carry a wrong layout.
